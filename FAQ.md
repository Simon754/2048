1、更新频率及Bug修复？  
在更新计划中我会发布未来更新时间，敬请关注。  
Bug在获晓后会立即着手修复，于下个release放出。  
2、Bug提交与新优化？  
在github上有完整的Bug提交机制，使用它就可以提交。  
更多讨论可以查看我的联系方式与我联系。  
3、提交格式？  
参考网上标准格式。  
4、新手引导？  
刚开始游戏页面只有2个方格有数字，将所有方块向同一方向运动，两个相同的数字方块会合并成一个它们的和的数字方块，而每一次操作都会在空白的方格处随机产生一个2或者4，如果最终得到一个2048的方块，那么恭喜你，你赢了!如果最后16个方格全部填满而且相邻的格子也各不相同，不能合并的时候，那么大侠请走好，重新来一盘仍然是好汉。  
5、游戏攻略？  
①要尽量让最大的那个数字方块保持在角落，并且移动时请注意保持队形，移动前要注意留心最大数方块所在的那一列或者那一行是满格的，保证它移动之后还是在角落里。  
②尽量将相同或接近的数字方块聚到一起，以便于消除合并。  
③当遇到相同的数字时，注意记住列叠加优于行叠加。  


1. Frequency of update and Bug repair?
In the update plan, I will release the future update time, please pay attention.
Bug will be repaired immediately after it is known and released in the next release.

3. Submission format?
Refer to the standard format on the Internet.

4. Novice Guidance?
At the beginning, there are only two squares with numbers on the game page. If all the squares move in the same direction, the two same squares will be merged into a sum of them. Each operation will randomly generate a 2 or 4 in the blank square. If you finally get a 2048 square, congratulations, you win! If the last 16 squares are all filled up and phase. Neighbor's lattices are also different, when they can't be merged, then the warrior please go well and come back is still a good man.

5. Game strategy?
(1) Keep the largest number square in the corner as far as possible, and pay attention to keeping the formation when moving. Before moving, pay attention to the column or row in which the largest number square is full, and ensure that it is still in the corner after moving.
(2) Put the same or similar digital blocks together as far as possible in order to eliminate the merge.
(3) When encountering the same number, remember that column superposition is better than row superposition.
